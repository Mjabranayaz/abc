                     "The staff at my store are nice. You get free food and drink, even though you aren't officially allowed it. You get to keep your tips if you are a waiter."]

negative_feedback = ["The only good thing was that it was located only three minutes walking from the place that I used to live.",
                     "If you want a culture where the quality of the product, the customer, the brand and the staff are key to how the business works, avoid C&C.",

                     "No real opportunities for advancement",

                     "Every unit is understaffed, always.",

                     "No gratitude for anything, lazy people get paid the same as hard-working employees",
                     "Payroll is terrible, consistently mess up pay and will throw the blame on each other rather than own their own mistakes.",
                     "Head office only cares about the numbers, not the people",
                     "Some managers are controlling to the point of bullying. While others couldn’t care less. The unit managers and HQ are also incompetent. Nothing gets resolved quickly or accurately.",
                     "Horrible management, no training at all",
                     "Terrible company to work for expected to give absolutely everything for nothing in return. Won’t pay for overtime.",
                     "A lot of unfairness. If the manager is your friend you'll have advantages Senior managers tend to be offensive and won't think twice before humiliating you.",
                     "Customers can be super nasty. They will call you names and shout at you for the smallest things.",
                     "Management are underqualified and not trained. Many health and safety violations, especially regarding food. Equipment doesn't get fixed, and the lack of training means things break a lot",
                     "Management are more concerned about reaching unrealistic goals than the wellbeing of their staff or the quality of service provided.",
                     "Longstanding staff are not appreciated or rewarded. Low pay. Little to no training.",
                     "Managers don’t listen, they tell us what to do with little or no consideration for us.",
                     "Rude customers sometimes, repetitive and same tasks most shifts.",
                     "Managers seem to treat staff as a machine, they don’t know how to treat us.",
                     "People do not stay with the company for long and there are not enough trained people to work in the shops.",
                     "A very poor company on SOOOOO many levels - they won't care about you - don't go & work for them - they are full of the proverbial !!"]
